## My process

### Built with

- Love ðŸ’–
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I love image overlays? I think they're just neat. 

My beloved `flex` got to shine in this project! While I didn't learn anything new this time around, I *have* noticed that I've gotten better at CSS-ing. My speed has also seen some improvement!

### Continued development

I want to get better at making cooler image overlays. I wonder what more I can do with them!
